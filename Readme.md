# Dealership 

This is a study project. The idea is that the dealership will have 3 Rest APIs to do CRUD operations in Clients, Cars and Sales.
When a sale occurs, a invoice should be created and sended through email to the client. Moreover, the invoice should be 
stored in a place, as the dealership will need to query some informations about the invoices. 

## Architecture

It will use a microservice architecture, that can be viewed below:
